# Design Specification: The Inverion Divide

**Project Codename:** Sovereign Mirror
**System Architecture:** React + Three.js (R3F) + UV/Python Bridge
**Primary Goal:** Transform chaotic solar telemetry into a volumetric, "white-hot" sanctuary.

---

## 1. System Overview

The interface is a real-time "Veracity Observer." It bridges the gap between raw astrophysical data and human-centric visual resonance. The system consists of three distinct layers:

- **The Bridge (Python/uv):** Fetches, scrubs, and serves NOAA/NASA JSON telemetry.
- **The Logic (Veracity Gate):** Audits the data stream for "Bypass" events or veracity spikes.
- **The Viewport (Resonance Trajectory):** A 2,000-node instanced particle system utilizing additive blending for "Ignition."

---

## 2. Visual Language & Aesthetics

- **The Core:** An incandescent, "overdriven" white-hot singularity created by the dense overlap of additive particles.
- **The Fringe:** High-velocity threads that transition from bright amber to deep, dark gold.
- **Texture:** Frayed silk and kinetic streaks. Particles are stretched quads (1:4 aspect ratio) aligned to the local velocity vector.
- **Atmosphere:** Deep black background (high contrast) with a blooming effect that allows light to "bleed" into the surrounding UI components.

---

## 3. Component Architecture

### A. ResonanceTrajectory (The Viewport)

- **Geometry:** `PlaneGeometry(0.015, 0.1)` (Stretched quads)
- **Material:** `MeshBasicMaterial` (Transparent: true, Blending: AdditiveBlending, DepthTest: false)
- **Instance Count:** 2,000 particles
- **Motion Logic:**
  - *Inhale/Exhale:* 4-second sinusoidal oscillation
  - *Centripetal Pull:* Inward lerp toward origin, modulated by solarDensity
  - *Shredding:* Bz (magnetic) spikes add random displacement to simulate turbulence

### B. TestDashboard (The Audit)

- **The Veracity Gate:** Compares V_active (live data) vs. V_control (simulation)
- **Bypass Detection:** Triggers a lockout if the delta between frames exceeds 0.5 units per tick
- **Node Status:** Real-time display of the "Tick Rate" and the current active node count

### C. The Bridge (The Backend)

- **Scrubber:** Mandatory try/except logic to catch 500 errors from NOAA
- **Sanity Floor:** Ensures values never hit NaN or Inf
- **Defaults:** Speed (400), Density (1.0), Temperature (100,000)

---

## 4. Technical Constraints (The "Ignition" Protocol)

To achieve the intended "Blinding" effect, the following settings must be strictly enforced:

- **Tone Mapping:** `THREE.NoToneMapping` (Allows HDR values > 1.0)
- **Intensity Curve:** Inverse square falloff (`I = 1 / d^2`)
- **Velocity Alignment:** Each instance matrix must rotate to face its own velocity vector to maintain the "streak" appearance

---

## 5. Success Criteria & Verification

| Criteria | Verification |
|----------|---------------|
| **Ignition Check** | Does the center of the viewport reach #FFFFFF? |
| **Performance** | Is the frame rate ≥ 60fps with 2,000 active instances? |
| **Veracity** | Does the UI accurately reflect a data drop-out (e.g., locking the gate)? |
| **Resonance** | Does the "breathing" cycle feel organic rather than mechanical? |

---

## 6. Implementation Instructions

1. **Start Bridge:** `cd server && uv run server.py`
2. **Initialize Frontend:** Ensure InstancedMesh is initialized with Float32Arrays for high-performance updates
3. **Apply Logic:** Ensure the useFrame loop pulls from a useRef to avoid React re-render bottlenecks

### Required Components

- `three` / `@react-three/fiber`: Viewport engine
- `uv`: Python package management
- `NOAA JSON API`: Real-time telemetry source

---

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success:** Use this design.md to stitch a functional, high-density solar interface.

## Session Log — June 2026

### ResonanceTrajectory changes
- `src/components/three/ResonanceTrajectory.tsx:122` — `KineticQuads` particle opacity reduced from 0.65 to 0.35. The earlier 0.65 was rendering the additive blending bright enough to wash out the orbital rings entirely.
- `ResonanceTrajectory.tsx:574` — InstancedMesh uses `frustumCulled={false}` so particles don't pop out at the camera edges (per the Stability Guards section in `AGENTS.md`).
- `ResonanceTrajectory.tsx:622-639` — ResizeObserver explicitly sets `canvas.style.width/height` on container resize (was missing).

### OrbitalRings changes (NEW)
- Complete rewrite of `src/components/three/OrbitalRings.tsx`. Old file was 3 thin concentric rings flattened onto the XZ plane. New file:
  - 5 thick concentric rings (radii 0.8–3.85), alternating CW/CCW rotation
  - 24/16/12/8/6 spokes per ring (major every 4th in white, minor in amber)
  - 32 white particles per ring drift along circumference, opacity pulsing
  - Wireframe outer sphere (r=4.2) rotating on Y axis
  - Rotating reticle crosshair (4 spokes at cardinals)
  - Pulse ring breathing scale + opacity
  - Glow ring radial gradient (3.4–4.1)
  - All face the camera (removed the `rotation={[Math.PI/2, 0, 0]}` that was flattening them)
  - Kinetic particles dimmed to keep rings visible

### Tone mapping compliance
- `THREE.NoToneMapping` still in effect (per design spec §4)
- Intensity curve inverse-square falloff still in effect
- Velocity alignment for streak appearance still in effect

### Aether-HUD spec integration
The `UI2/UI-enhanced/DESIGN.md` spec is being incrementally integrated. Current alignment:
- JetBrains Mono ✓ (sole typeface in app)
- `#FFB300` primary amber ✓
- `#000000` background ✓
- 4px modular unit grid ✓ (via Tailwind)
- Sharp (0px) corners ✓
- Wireframe outer sphere ✓ (matches "Central Sphere" component)

### Pending from Aether-HUD
- Scanline effect (CSS class `.cui-scanline` defined, not yet applied to panels)
- 45° chamfered corners on panel headers (CSS class `.cui-corner` defined, not yet applied)
- Module ID prefixes in panel headers (e.g., `MOD-0192`) — not yet added
- Square brackets around status chips (e.g., `[ STATUS: OK ]`) — not yet added
